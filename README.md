# DSCI_6015_AI-Cyber-Security_MidTerm_Project

### The goal of this project research is to use machine learning models to detect and classify malware. 

### There are three parts in this project. 

#### 1. The first step is to use the Ember opensource dataset, EMBER-2017 v2, to train a deep neural network to identify PE files as malware or benign.
#### 2. The second step is to upload the model to the cloud and create an endpoint (API) for it.
#### 3. The final step is to construct a client that is nothing more than a python script that imports a PE file and determines if it is malware or benign.
